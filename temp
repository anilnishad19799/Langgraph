🚀 Project Title: Vision-Based Quality Assurance in Electronic Circuits

🧠 Problem Statement
In our organization, electronic circuit logic diagrams are designed and stored as large PDFs (sometimes 5000+ pages).
The quality team needs to verify that each logic circuit follows a set of predefined logical and functional rules (provided by DENSO).
However, these rules can’t be directly applied to PDFs — they require structured, tabular data.
So our goal was to automate the quality assurance process using computer vision + OCR + rule-based logic, converting the visual circuit diagrams into structured data.

🏗️ System Overview

We divided the entire project into two main modules:
Data Modelling (Vision to Structured Data)
Rule Checker (Algorithmic Validation on Structured Data)


🔹 1. Data Modelling Phase
Step 1: PDF to Images
The input is a large PDF (up to 5000 pages).
We convert each page into high-resolution images using:
pdf2image and PyMuPDF.
Each image is stored sequentially with proper page order and naming conventions.

Step 2: Object Detection using YOLOv11
We trained a YOLOv11 model on labeled circuit diagram images.
The model detects components like:
Contacts, Coils, Blocks, and other logic gates.
The model performs with high accuracy, identifying each component along with its bounding box coordinates (X, Y).

Step 3: OCR for Text Extraction
Along with YOLO detections, we apply OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract textual details:
Gate labels, variable names, operands, and comments.
This helps us link detected components with their functional or logical metadata.

Step 4: Data Integration
Using Python, we combine YOLOv11 output and OCR output.
By comparing their X–Y coordinates, we map each detected component with its text.
The final structured information for each image is stored in a Pandas DataFrame, including:

Task name
Section name
Gate type (contact, coil, etc.)
Variable name and operand
Comments
Rung number (sequence)
So, effectively, we are converting vision-based unstructured PDF data into a structured tabular dataset.


🔹 2. Rule Checker Phase (Algorithm Application)

Once we have the structured data, we apply custom validation algorithms defined by DENSO.
Example Rule:
In the AutoRun section,
For every outcoil having comment “MD 1 CYCLE START”,
There should be at least one contact with:
Variable name “CYCLE STOP” and
Comment “cycle stop”.
If this condition matches → ✅ OK
If not → ❌ NG (Not Good)
All such rules are implemented using Python logic directly on the Pandas DataFrame, enabling quick validation and reporting.

⚙️ Backend Processing
Processing such large PDFs (with thousands of pages) is time and compute intensive, so we optimized the backend pipeline:
Used Celery for background task management.
Used Redis as a message broker to track and update task progress.
Exposed real-time progress updates via WebSocket, showing the user live page-by-page status.
This prevents connection drops (which could happen with long HTTP requests).

☁️ Deployment & Architecture
Backend: Python (FastAPI) + Celery + Redis
Frontend: React.js (deployed separately)
Model: YOLOv11 (custom trained)
Containerization: Docker (separate containers for backend, frontend, and model services)
Deployment: Deployed on cloud infrastructure for scalability and parallel processing.

🧩 Key Highlights
Feature	Description
Automation	Fully automated circuit rule-checking process
Computer Vision	YOLOv11 detects circuit components visually
OCR + NLP	Extracts text details for logic validation
Scalable Architecture	Dockerized, background processing using Celery
Real-time Feedback	WebSocket + Redis updates processing status
Data Transformation	Vision data → Structured DataFrame for rule-based analysis

🎯 Outcome
The system can automatically process thousands of circuit pages and detect logical inconsistencies within minutes.
This replaced manual checking, saving significant time and human effort, and increased accuracy in quality assurance.

🗣️ How to Explain in Interview (Short Version)
“Our project automates quality assurance for electronic circuit diagrams.
We take large PDF circuit drawings, convert them into images, and run a YOLOv11 model to detect circuit components. Then, we use OCR to extract text details like variable names and comments.
By combining these using their coordinates, we convert vision-based data into structured tabular data in Pandas.
Once structured, we apply rule-based logic (as given by DENSO) to check whether the circuit logic is valid.
We use Celery, Redis, and WebSocket for scalable, real-time processing, and the entire system is containerized and deployed on the cloud.”
